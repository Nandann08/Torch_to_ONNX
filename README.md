# Torch_to_ONNX

This jupyter notebook includes how to convert a Torch model to ONNX format. I am using microft's onnxruntime library for the convertion.
The notebook includes inference part and also comparision of logits and outputs from the original torch model and the model which is converted to onnc format.
